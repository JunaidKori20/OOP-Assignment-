FIRST PEOGRAM
This is a simple Java program called BasicCalculator. It defines a class with a main method. Inside the main method, it declares two integer variables, firstNumber and secondNumber, with values 2 and 5, respectively. It then adds these two numbers and stores the result in another variable called result. Finally, it prints the equation and the result using System.out.println. In this case, it would print "2 + 5 = 7" to the console.

2ND PROGRAM

This Java program, StudentStatistics, processes a string containing student data and calculates various statistics. Here's a breakdown:

String studentData: Contains a comma-separated list of student names and their corresponding scores.

String[] studentRecords: Splits the studentData string into an array of individual student records using ", " as the delimiter.

String[] studentNames, int[] studentScores: Arrays to store student names and their respective scores.

int totalStudents: Keeps track of the total number of students.

int totalScore: Accumulates the total score of all students.

int highestScore, lowestScore: Variables to track the highest and lowest scores.

String highestScorer, lowestScorer: Variables to store the names of the students with the highest and lowest scores.

for loop: Iterates through each student record, extracts the name and score, and populates the respective arrays. It also updates totalScore and checks for the highest and lowest scores.

double averageScore: Calculates the average score by dividing totalScore by the total number of students.

System.out.println: Prints the following statistics to the console:

Total number of students.
Average score of all students.
Highest score and the student who achieved it.
Lowest score and the student who achieved it.
In summary, the program analyzes student data and provides insights into the total number of students, average score, highest score, and lowest score along with the corresponding students' names.
